Matt's Proposed Changes:

More like Matt's proposed bugfixes really...

- Changed model class for celiing lights to **prop_dynamic**
	- Ceiling light props are no longer errors after compiling

- Removed duplicate light prop 
	- It was the light closest to the door, there were 2 stacked inside eachother

- Fixed door rotation and starting positions
	Changes to properties and flags for both doors:
	- Property: "Spawn Position" --> "Open"
	- Property: "Pitch Yaw Roll (Y Z X)" --> "0 0 0"
	- Property: "Distance" --> "-90"
	- Property:  "Allow Physics Gun" --> "No"
	- Flag:  "One-way" --> CHECKED

	Notes:  Doors start in open position as before, but will now close to the correct place.  To start the doors in
		the closed position, change the "Spawn Position" property to "Closed".  Doors will open in the same 
		direction regardless of player position.  Doors can no longer be grabbed by the player with the phys gun.
